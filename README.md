# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple terminal game where a user plays rock-paper-scissors against a 'computer'. A local MongoDB database is used to track user choices and in turn, create a probabilistic skew for how the 'computer' will play against the user. Personal project written in Python, PyMongo driver is used for the local database.
