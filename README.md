# Rock-Paper-Scissors
making a quick little rock paper scissors game
just a fun project to get practice with the PyMongo MongoDB driver
allows the user to play rock paper scissors against the computer
eventually, the user's choices will be tracked in the database to change the frequency that the computer chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
